# Project: SNHU Travel Application Development
# Competency

-Explain the different methodologies and stages involved in the software development life cycle

-Apply the stages of the software development life cycle within an agile development environment

-Evaluate various software development methodologies and tools

# Description
This project involves the development of an innovative application for SNHU Travel, a travel agency looking to expand its client base through the use of modern software solutions. The development process will utilize the Scrum-Agile methodology to foster collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement.

# Essential Questions

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs requires a thorough understanding of the target audience and their expectations. This can be achieved through direct communication, surveys, and feedback sessions. In the context of our project for SNHU Travel, creating "user stories" has been instrumental. For example, a user story such as "As a travel agent, I want to quickly access client travel preferences so that I can provide tailored recommendations" allows the team to focus on delivering features that directly address user pain points. This method not only clarifies requirements but also prioritizes development tasks based on user impact, ensuring that the end product aligns closely with user expectations.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
My approach to developing programs is iterative and user-focused. I embrace Agile principles, which promote flexibility and responsiveness to change. The Scrum framework, in particular, encourages regular check-ins, sprint planning, and retrospectives, allowing the team to continuously refine our processes and adapt to feedback. Moving forward, I hope to incorporate additional Agile practices such as pair programming and continuous integration, which will enhance collaboration and ensure that the application remains aligned with user needs throughout the development cycle.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development involves effective communication, collaboration, and a commitment to shared goals. It means actively participating in discussions, being open to feedback, and supporting fellow team members in their tasks. In the Scrum environment, this is particularly important as we rely on each other’s strengths to deliver high-quality work. A good team member also takes responsibility for their contributions, meets deadlines, and fosters a positive and inclusive team culture. By being adaptable and willing to help others, we can create an environment where everyone feels valued and motivated to succeed.

# Conclusion
Reflecting on these essential questions has deepened my understanding of the software development process, especially within the Agile framework. By focusing on user needs, embracing Agile methodologies, and striving to be a supportive team member, I aim to contribute positively to the success of the SNHU Travel application and future projects at ChadaTech.
