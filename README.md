# Project: SNHU Travel Application Development
## Competency

-Explain the different methodologies and stages involved in the software development life cycle

-Apply the stages of the software development life cycle within an agile development environment

-Evaluate various software development methodologies and tools

## Description
This project involved the development of an innovative application for SNHU Travel, a travel agency that sought to expand its client base through the use of modern software solutions. The development process utilized the Scrum-Agile methodology to foster collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement.

## Essential Questions

### How did I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How did creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs required a thorough understanding of the target audience and their expectations. This was achieved through direct communication, surveys, and feedback sessions. In the context of our project for SNHU Travel, creating "user stories" proved to be instrumental. For example, a user story such as "As a travel agent, I want to quickly access client travel preferences so that I can provide tailored recommendations" allowed the team to focus on delivering features that directly addressed user pain points. This method not only clarified requirements but also prioritized development tasks based on user impact, ensuring that the end product aligned closely with user expectations.

### How did I approach developing programs? What Agile processes did I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs was iterative and user-focused. I embraced Agile principles, which promoted flexibility and responsiveness to change. The Scrum framework, in particular, encouraged regular check-ins, sprint planning, and retrospectives, allowing the team to continuously refine our processes and adapt to feedback. Moving forward, I hoped to incorporate additional Agile practices such as pair programming and continuous integration, which would enhance collaboration and ensure that the application remained aligned with user needs throughout the development cycle.

### What did it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development involved effective communication, collaboration, and a commitment to shared goals. It meant actively participating in discussions, being open to feedback, and supporting fellow team members in their tasks. In the Scrum environment, this was particularly important as we relied on each other’s strengths to deliver high-quality work. A good team member also took responsibility for their contributions, met deadlines, and fostered a positive and inclusive team culture. By being adaptable and willing to help others, we created an environment where everyone felt valued and motivated to succeed.

## Conclusion

Reflecting on these essential questions deepened my understanding of the software development process, especially within the Agile framework. By focusing on user needs, embracing Agile methodologies, and striving to be a supportive team member, I aimed to contribute positively to the success of the SNHU Travel application and future projects at ChadaTech.
